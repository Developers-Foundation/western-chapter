        <p class="description">As of January 2017, Developers' Foundation has successfully expanded into three
            campuses, at Western University, Queen's and UNICAMP (Brazil). Having successfully
            chartered Western's chapter, Developers' Foundation has developed over a dozen
            functional websites for Student and Community organizations.</p>

        <p class="description">Throughout the first semester your clients will concentrate solely on catering to Student
            organizations and charities/NPO. During the second semester of this school year, HQ will
            recommend to include one small business client per month. This will be DFâ€™s main source
            of financial support. On average, we expected each chapter to work on at least 3 clients per
            month. Another HQ initiative that we super excited about, is to increase the current number
            of chapters, from 3 to 6 by the end of the second semester.</p>

        <p class="description">We have also built our very own CMS (think wordpress), to make it easier for both our clients
            and us when it comes to content maintenance. We believe this has a huge value in also
            building an ecosystem where NPO and charities can rely on.</p>
