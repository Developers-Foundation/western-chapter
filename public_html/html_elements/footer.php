                <br/>
                <div class='innerText'>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under
                    the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in
                    control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the
                    COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect
                    children's privacy and safety online.<br><br></div>
                <div class='innerText'>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.

                <br/>
                <div class='innerText'>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in
                    the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the
                    development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information
                    Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various
                    privacy laws that protect personal information.<br><br></div>
                <div class='innerText'><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take
                        the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong></div>
                <div class='innerText'>We will notify you via email</div>

                <div class='innerText'><br>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that
                    individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and
                    processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have
                    enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or
                    government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
